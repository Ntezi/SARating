Unfortunately that did not happen and the few days I was there I got no sleep or rest. Upon my arrival I noticed the primary school right next to the hotel. The school is in full swing from 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM with kids screaming and shouting outside. Then to my horror the next morning I got woken up at 3:30 AM by all the roosters in the area and at 5:00 AM I heard singing, screaming, shouting, preaching in a microphone and instruments being played. It turns out there is a church choir right next to the hotel also. This is how I got woken up every morning while there and the choir went on until 9:00 PM. At 00:30 one night I got woken up by guests checking into the room next to mine. The entire hotel was empty so why put guests next to me in the middle of the night? The African guests who arrived were SUPER noisy so I knocked on the wall for them to be quiet. They then complained about me. What! So the night receptionist came to my room and asked what the problem was. The guests were moved to another floor and all the noise with the suitcases etc. got too much for me. Not all the staff spoke English which caused some confusion in the restaurant. When I got to Kigali I called the hotel for directions but no one answered my first 3 attempts. The same thing happened 4 other times when I was in town calling for directions back to the hotel. One of the times I was standing in the rain. No desk chair or desk/bed side lamps. Daily power cuts, the cable TV did not work very well when it rained and not at all the last day I was there. Paper thin walls, no elevator, 2 hangers only in the closet, the hotel charges more for the airport transportation than the regular taxis. No safe box or fridge in the room, no shower curtains, no fan or a/c. The hotel is quite far from downtown. No phone in the room. I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a quiet place. Nice hot shower, strong reliable WI-FI connection, a large room, super clean throughout, nice staff and owner, comfortable bed, good food but super slow service. New furniture in the rooms.", "stay_date": "September 2018"},

There is nothing in the vicinity. The taxi drivers that the hotel called for us didn't speak English or French, and didn't know their way around town - it ended in annoyance both times.\rAlso, I'm sorry to say, it's just too noisy for a pleasant stay. We stayed for 2 nights, and night 1 - at 4am I was woken by a Mosque, at 5am the preacher at the church next door started screaming through a megaphone, and by 8am the primary school was in full swing.  Megaphone praying lasted from 6am to 6pm, with no chance of quiet.  Night 2 - a football team arrived at around 7/8 in the morning and began screaming and shouting, banging on doors - and continued all day.\rI feel bad saying this because the owners are generally great and lovely people, but we didn't sleep for 2 days because of the noise so I think it's fair to warn others. The room was very nice - comfy bed, exceptionally clean (although no daily service of the room), and powerful shower.  The breakfast was really delicious (omelette, pancakes and fresh fruits), and it's also a great benefit to have a good restaurant on location - the night we arrived we enjoyed drinks and nice fish and meat kebabs for dinner.  \rThe staff are very, very friendly - although yes, you should speak French to communicate well with them.", "stay_date": "February 2018"},

The rooms are large and clean, and housekeeping does a wonderful job of keeping everything tidy and well stocked.  The wifi is dependable, which can sometimes be a rarity in Kigali hotels.

This time i stayed for five nights. The reason i came back was because of the location which is fantastic and the breakfast. But now i really regret my decision.\nThis is the worst hotel experience i have had, the first night was really bad. First of all, when i was checking in, i was told the room that i booked was not available so i had to be given a different room. One with two twin beds that were really tiny. They offered to join up the beds and promised to move me the following day to a room according to my booking. The whole thing was handled really well by the hotel staff in particular Fiable, i did not seem to mind the inconvenience just for a night.\nThe worst part and the worst experience is that at around midnight on my first night i woke up because i was being bitten by BEDBUGS. Unbelievable. I could not imagine such a ''posh'' hotel could have bedbugs. It calls to question their hygiene standards. I immediately woke u and rushed to the reception to complain, and so that they could believe me, i took photos of the bugs and even carried a sample of a big bedbug to the reception and gave it to Fiable. So my room had to be changed in the middle of the night. Of course i did not sleep well as i kept on waking up at night many times to check if my new bed and room has those bugs. I did not see any in this one.\nFollowing day, my room was changed to the one i had booked but then again i experienced a different challenge in my third room. The internet connection was terrible. (please note other areas of the hotel, and other rooms i had been in, internet was excellent). In this room it was so bad. I complained several times about it till i gave up. So i struggled to do my work (reason i was here) with terrible internet, of course it was frustrating for the remaining days i spent in the hotel.\nOn check out again, i was faced with more dissapointment. the staff", "stay_date": "February 2018"},

The breakfast was the best in all of Rwanda in my opinion\u20143 weeks there and no other place the same, amazing breakfast spread. The poolside bar/restaurant is comes to life every afternoon and evening, especially on the weekends when locals and foreigners alike come in for drinks.

The hotel itself is good, just be wary of what foods you eat. Darker/heavier curtains to block out noise and light would be good.

(Later on when asked they explained it was because an existing guest decided to extend their stay. A confirmed booking should not be a \"maybe, if our other guests feel like it\". Unreliable.\nSecond issue:\nAirport pickup: we get to guest-pickup area and don't see our names. We wait 20 minutes before i call. They insists that the pickup driver is there. I wait a bit and finally see my name. The driver had apparently been there but had such a stack of name cards he was flashing that he never flashed our names. To avoid this in the future simply include the hotel name on the cards and waiting guests will know to approach and confirm.\nIssue 3:\nI had pre-arranged and re-confirmed a morning transfer with the hotel to our tour location. but it was 30 mins late, I had the hotel call the tour company and plead with them to wait. Luckily they waited but they had to keep a group of 10 waiting and we were \"those jerks\" who made everyone wait. Stressful, annoying, unreliable.\nIssue 4:\nThe general location was not that good. One night there was loud partying till 5am. A second afternoon there was a 2 hour shouting match between vendors. \nAll said i would not stay there again and would find a better place.

They went above and beyond!! And just truly kind and wonderful people. They really made me feel like a home away from home (I was there for 8 days). I would go back in a heartbeat!! In addition to the amazing staff - the hotel was super clean and well taken care of, the room was modern and super comfortable, and an incredible view, and the food was fantastic!! And I loved the location - if you want to get a taste of the local vibe this is definitely the place to stay! And it's just a short car ride away to any tourist locations. Best bang for your buck!! THANK YOU THANK YOU Five to Five staff for an unforgettable stay!!", "stay_date": "December 2018"},

Breathtaking view. Highly recommended", "review": "I would have loved to taste the Rwandan/African cuisine. This was not offered on the menu. Mainly European dishes were on offer. I came to Rwanda to explore, so it would have been nice if they promote their local or other African cuisine too, as African cuisines are extremely versatile, organic and healthy. This was my only minor for the hotel.\rI had to get used to the overall sight of armed security forces everywhere you go in Kigali. I felt like I was in a police state and could get shot any moment if I made the wrong move. Even in the hotel, you and your bags had to go through this security portal. Because of this, I didn't really, feel free. At several occasions during my tour I was told not to film or take any pictures of certain areas (presidential/governmental areas) - and the way I was cautioned not to do it, was told with such fear in the voice. My usual self would have ignored the warning and taking a cute picture of myself and the surroundings, with no harm in mind. Uganda also had armed forces, but they were less intimidating and more accommodating than in Rwanda. I find it sad that people have to live in fear. On the other hand, I understand given the history. Crime is very low, things are well organised in comparison to other African countries. World class experience. By far the best place I've stayed in East Africa, and for overall experience, the best place I've ever stayed. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a refreshing drink, and my bags were dropped off in my room. I was able to have breakfast too. The best part of the room was the magnificent view overlooking the hills/mountains of Kigali. This made me enjoy the balcony even more. I wish I could have stayed longer. The bed was comfortable and the AC worked. They even thought of having an Iron in the room, and other basic items like toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving razors, water etc. More than I expected. After visiting 5 countries in less than a month in East Africa,  and staying at places that have no understanding of the needs of their customers, I felt really at home in this hotel. The staff were also very friendly. I never drink tea with milk, but I did enjoy the African tea very much. I will look for the recipe, so I can make it at home. Airport pickup was just brilliant. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.", "stay_date": "January 2019"},

The security staff was having a morning wash for everyone to see. I want back several times and there was still no staff. it is now 7.45 am and the strangest breakfast arrived. We had no time to eat it really, so we took our bags and left the room. There was still no staff thus we had no way of checking out. Our driver is it happened was waiting inside the property and he can testify there was no one there to check us out. with a long drive ahead we left, knowing the hotel had our cc details and with booking.com being the conduit we deemed this to be fine in terms of payment. However, we discovered a few hours into our trip that we had omitted leaving the key behind. Speaking with the hotel I assured them we would bring the key back on our return to Kigali 2 days later. I was then told by the Belgian owner Rudy he would call the police to report us for leaving without paying and with the keys. Nothing I could do about that other than sticking by our word to bring the keys back which we did. meanwhile I received several calls from the increasingly erratic owner. He then elected to charge us a relatively huge sum for purportedly changing the locks to the room we had stayed in as we had the key. This in itself is odd for more than one reason. I have certainly never been to a hotel where the one room key handed to the guests is the only key for that room. Secondly, this key was also used to enter into the guest room area of the establishment. I never received a breakdown of the bill and when I returned with the key the owner was not there and he has not picked up the phone on the many I tried contacting him since. I would insist in receiving the invoice and of course also to be credited for the ridiculous sum charged. I would expect booking.com to assist without taking sides, and post this review. Thanks. the steak at dinner was good, after we sent the first back as it came well done and we asked for medium rear.

We kept hearing 'I'll call\" or \"let me find out\" with no follow up. We were not given the room that we booked (deluxe king) but instead were given the much worse family suite. It was really shabby, for example: mold and peeling paint in the bathroom, non functioning mini fridge, dirty behind the nightstands and the door right outside is very loud and woke us up constantly. After the first night, we were able to change to the nicer room we actually booked, but the front desk staff behaved as though it was a favor to allow us to do so. When we realized we'd left our plug adapters in the first room, new guests were already checked in and despite asking housekeeping and the front desk multiple times throughout the day, they were never recovered. The driver offered by the hotel is ludicrously expensive, arrange your own taxis. The coffee was good, and the restaurant at breakfast has nice atmosphere and we enjoyed the food choices, though they don't change from day to day.", "stay_date": "August 2018"},

It would have been great to stay longer. The Ubumwe exceeded our expectations. After travelling for 2 weeks all around Rwanda it was a pleasure to stay here for our last few days. It was very comfortable, great room, great breakfast and a relatively narrow but good length swimming pool which we had to ourselves most of the time we were there. It is in a good location, close to supermarkets, shops, foreign exchange and other amenities. Above all, the staff were excellent. All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful but we have to give a special mention to Eric who was there when we arrived and showed us our room, was there every morning to greet us for breakfast and was always very helpful and willing to do what had to be done to make our stay more enjoyable.

I expected English to be a given, but it's not. You can only communicate basic info with some of the staff. We learned who spoke the best English and just waited until they came to work to communicate with them. \rThe beds are hard as a rock. If you like hard beds, then you will be fine. If not, expect to come home with a backache. \rThere is a lot of abject poverty in Rwanda and this property is built next to what I would call a shanty town. Homes with sheet metal roofs, pothole-filled dirt road, etc. To be fair, it's not uncommon for there to be multi-million dollar gated homes right next to shacks, so that's not an issue. Just don't be alarmed when you arrive at the property after traveling down a dirt road for a couple hundred yards and see these shacks right outside the walls of the property.\rBecause there is a working class neighborhood right next to the property, it is very loud on the road, very early in the day. There is a lot of street noise, people yelling at each other, and children in the streets from sunup on throughout the day. It is impossible to sleep if you are not in the bedroom with the air conditioning going. Please note that we never felt unsafe. There is also a guard on duty at the locked gate 24 hours a day. Just know that someone will be honking a car horn or yelling at someone from the street as early as 5:30 am every day. Overall, the apartment was great and EVERYTHING was very clean. The staff was very accommodating and repaired items whenever we made them aware of the situation. The staff was very polite and everyone was a hard worker.  They have a car service that was great. They took us anywhere we asked for a very reasonable fee. The air conditioner in the main bedroom was a lifesaver. It worked great! The wifi was consistent, but they have several wifi codes.

We entered a grand  looking foyer and were greeted with some fresh mango juice. The staff go beyond their duty to make you feel happy and comfortable and my children did not want to leave the hotel premises, because they had so much fun there and almost felt at home. The pool area is very clean and relaxing. I also loved the fact that we had three restaurants (Italian, Chinese, and Indian) in the hotel, which means we did not need to leave just for eating. The food is delicious and can be served in the restaurant itself (with pool view), in the garden, or at the pool itself. We also watched the world cup on a huge cinema screen, met many people, and were really happy throughout.  Rooms are clean with big, nice bathrooms.

Anything we ordered was delayed and when it was finally delivered there was no apology. The staff are not trained and have very poor people skills and possess very little information. E.g. We ordered food in the room but the person picking our order had no idea what the menu contained and had to refer us to the chef who referred us back to the waiter not to say the food came in an hour later and when we questioned the delay the waiter notified us that the kitchen was busy. In my years of travel I found that rude not honest. I had a sick daughter so it got me very mad. I sent clothes for laundry and when I requested the same back after five hours it was another one and a half hour drama. When the stay was pathetic yet the facilities are great.

Taxis are handy too but much expensive and unlike the motorcycles, they tend to take ages to reach the city. The third option is to download a local App \"MOVE\" and you can easily order a ride - I took this option to & from the airport (the airport is very close to the apartment - 'However, when flying out make sure you leave a lot of time for going through a lot of security layers').\rWould I recommend this place? - oh yes! 100 %", "stay_date": "March 2019"},

Perfect way of being in Kigali and will definitely stay there again!", "review": "- Some of the pictures posted on booking.com can be misleading as they showcase the entire full plan of Phoenix Apartments to which only 25% of has been built. \r- For instance traveling with kids, the swimmingpool was one of the major reason we decided to stay there, so you could imagine how hard it was having to tell a 5years old that the pool we promised and we saw in the pictures wasn't there afterall. \r- There is no doubt that Phoenix Apartments is one of the good parts-hotels out there and i acknowledge the fact that it is still undergoing construction, but it would be a great deal for the guests if the road to the apartments from the main road could be renovated just a little bit as it's in a very bad shape for cars to drive in, especially when it rains.\r- Another thing that disturbed us was the unprofessional* of housekeepers who had to be re-reminded to clean the apartments and to change the towels on a daily basis resulting in having it done late in the afternoons or not at all, although it is supposed to be a part of their daily routines. Beautiful, modern, clean, comfort, private homes/condos/apartments yet with best exclusive hotel services, such as doormen service, housekeeping/daily-cleaning service and a 24/7H reception.\rGreat family friendly place/location or for those looking for privacy far from down-town chaos but yet with easy route to the city (for those with a car) as well as shorter trip to the airport. \rThe rooms are big with huge big glass windows/doors to each balcony and are furnished with big closets, kingsize beds with private toilets and showers, and the apartments are well equipped with everything you'd need in a normal household from microwave, stove, washing-machine and all kinds of kitchen utilities (although it would be nicer with more glasses, plates and cups). \rAnother thing that amazed us was how far some employees would go providing that extra best services to your guests. A big thanks to Channy, a wonderful friendly receptionist who was there to answer all our various questions as well as helping out to resolve whatever issues we had whenever asked 24/7 wether by phone or in person. Another big thanks to Tony, a fantastic nice young man who suddenly took the charge of being our private chef, cooking us whatever/whenever we wanted throughout our entire stay after realising that the stove in our partment had some electric issues and wasn't gonna work.

I was not aware of this initially so I left for the day with my key only to come back and be explained to the above. Patience was very quick in sorting me out and we waited while they cleaned the room at 10 p.m. (which was quite nice of them actually to do it at that hour). However we could have avoided all this if there had been some prior communication. Colourful rooms with such character, look very fresh, really nice showers. The decor of Yambi is quite nice, very nice for photos which my best friend and I took many of.  My favourite part of the place was the swing, where I would spend some quiet time. The food was good.

He went out of his way to make us feel at home.  We mingled so well with his family that at no time did we feel like we were just tourists.  Honestly from Jean Claude's hospitality in addition to the welcoming nature of the Rwandese people I will be going back to Kigali in the near future and will definitely be staying at High Ground Villa.  JC keep up the good work.  Keep smiling and keep making your guests feeling so at home and many of them will keep coming back.  Thanks so much for making our stay so comfortable.

The most outstanding thing is the Staff!  I was met by Diane and her colleagues whose welcome was both warm, natural and Professional. The service was all from ladies even the cleaner was a lady.  From previous experience, for every 5 ladies in a Hotel as staff ..... at least two are grumpy!! In this case these were exceptionally warm.\nOnline check in Via Booking.com was a breeze and I didn't need a credit card. No sooner head I received confirmation, head I also received notification of provision of a car to pick me as part of the room cost (Awesome!). The driver  Sean too picked me on time, was very professional, courteous and attentive and even took me somewhere to do some shopping as I was famished.\nThe hotel itself is not to large, I don't think there are bite than 20 rooms.  However the room I was in 113 was clean, with toiletries  (except toothpaste and a tooth brush). The room had bed sandals (disposable) a tiny fridge (yippee!) Good ventilation and a balcony.  However the balcony over looked a weird neighbourhood so there was nothing in terms of a view. Though since I was tucked away at the back, I am sure there were other better views at the front.\nThe breakfast is on order, so you do not go down stairs before making your order. I think the dining area too was quite tiny and dark. Most of the hotel members preferred to easy outside at the bar. There was not much in terms of options for breakfast (but then again, I am a picky eater) However there was a fairly decent offering of bread, eggs, fruits, teas, coffee and if you wanted juice it was at an extra cost.\nThe bed, mattress was really comfortable, and quite quiet contrary to my expectations. So my sleep was great and restful! The TV is tuned to francophone channels and the WIFI was a welcome relief as it was fast and strong.\nThe water in the shower worked well (tiny cubicle) it was equipped with a hair drier too.\nAll in all,  I did enjoy my stay most especially the staff and the comfort!", "stay_date": "November 2018"},

First time I ran out of water in the bathroom room, they told me that it was a pump problem, then sent someone to my room to fix it. One of the staff members offered me to change the room, but as the water returned, another receptionist assured me that it was not going to happen again, so I chose to stay, but it did. In the following days I discovered that it was not a one off situation. - I usually had water until around 9am, then the water would be back in the pipes early afternoon, all night and early morning... until around 9am. As I usually spent most of the day out it was ok, but it was not nice the way the staff handled the situatiation, not being straight forward about the real situation. \rThe street that takes us to the hotel is not paved and there's no street light, so walking to the hotel at night can be a bit complicated as you are not sure where you are stepping and because the road is very uneven. In spite of the dark I felt safe. \rI was charged for a \"taxe de sejour\" that was not mentioned on my booking.com reservation, and this was a surprise as VAT was already included and Booking.com did not informe me that I would need to pay extra taxes. This taxe de sejour cost me nearly the price of another night. As I haven't found so far any information about hotels in Rwanda charging Taxe de sejour, I'm not sure if it is a Rwandan policy or if it is a Rouge by Desir policy. In any case, Bookin.com should inform us about any extra taxes, fees. The room was big, very clean, and had a beautiful view. \rStudents of a local university live in the hotel, giving it an extra touch, a lively home feeling. It was nice to arrive at the hotel in the evening and see the students on the lounge working on their computers and chatting. \rThe staff members are polite. The hotel is located in a good and safe neighbourhood, with supermarket and places to eat about 5 minute-walk or even less.\rIt was pleasant to sit at the balcony and read. \rThere is a big and nice swimming pool.", "stay_date": "October 2018"},

I assume it is a rip off scam to try to convince customers to pay extra without realising they are being ripped off.

I suppose that I could have voiced this more, but just got the feeling that it was not really meant to be a \"shared\" space, or perhaps that previous guests had just not used the space so they didn't realize that they were inconveniencing others who wanted to also use it.\rPayment upon checking out was difficult, they aren't set up to take cards. I assumed that the payment had been made through booking.com, but it was not and I did not have enough cash on me. Had to request an email address to make the payment through paypal, but this whole process took an extra 10 minutes while my taxi was waiting. The value for money is very good, the neighborhood (Kimi) is excellent. There are many restaurants, cafes and a great gym just a block away. The room is big, bed is comfortable, internet is strong.

I complained to the front desk who came back to inform me that the noise was coming from outside the property and they had \"no power to do anything about it.\" A night during which I hardly slept was followed by a 6am call to inform me that my 7:45 airport transfer wouldn't work because of Umuganda on the day. Which is perfectly understood, but surely this should have occurred to the person at the desk when I made the request the night before? And that's how we left the hotel... tired for lack of sleep the night before, and in a mad rush to get to the airport. No breakfast obviously. All this with my three year old daughter in tow... I was looking for a place that wouldn't feel too \"attending a conference\" as some established global chains tend to.  Met my expectations in this regard. Staff were generally great and made my daughter feel extra special. The owner Josh was also pleasant and engaging and had great ideas for child-friendly activities which were important for us. Nice ambiance and lived up to the eco-friendly expectations I had. Good restaurant too.", "stay_date": "December 2018"},

Great service, good people great vibe", "review": "Very little disappointed me at this hotel. The coffee station not being in the room was a bit of an inconvenience for me. The hotel website looks to one currency EUR & doesn't have a built-in converter to assist. Something that can turn one off whilst doing a search online for hotels. The hotel has a wake-up call service but don't depend on it. I have learned the hard way at another hotel. I decided to put ONOMO KG to the test it to the test & unfortunately failed. Never received that call.\rYes, i would stay here again. Everything about this hotel just exceeded my expectation. Home away from home indeed. This hotel was a random choice, a hotel chain that is new to me. Let me start by appreciating the staff of ONOMO Kigali. An exceptional team that strives to cater to your needs. I am talking from the housekeepers, Security guard, the waiters, front desk personnel, Assistant Managers & General Manager. Comfortable rooms equipped with separate shower & ablution facility. Rooms interior design is chic & modern with wall art. Well, the rooms are not large but functional. Wide opening windows, of course with safety limits. Excellent wifi coverage & Speed. Most importantly the rooms are airconditioned. No coffee stations yet in the rooms however coffee is complimentary for staying guest at the lounge on the ground floor. The hotel bost with facilities of an infinity pool overlooking the neighbouring settlements, a gym, small garden, conference rooms, open plan lounge with bar flowing out into the Pool Terrace. Plenty of seating space, be it for a candlelight dinner, a Business Brunch or a quick meeting with friends. Food is great by the way. Not sure if parking is free. The Airport shuttle service was on time upon my check out. Aaaah and not forgetting the surprise birthday the staff setup...lol. It was really special. Find Leo, William or Carine at this hotel if all fails. I am sure they will find a way. To Jorge, Everything rises & falls on leadership. You lead a team that has the future of this hotel at heart.

There was not information when reserving or checking in that this booking did not include breakfast, and that was a surprise to have to pay extra - in Kigali all the hotels I stay in give breakfast. Lastly, we arrived late to the hotel after picking up my husband from airport in evening. At 9:30pm only buffet was available for dinner, nothing to order on menu.

This is the only thing I can think of as improvement but with the amazing staff I am sure that this will be done! The staff was AMAZINGLY kind, I felt so well taken care of. Anything I needed they attended to, and everyone was just genuinely kind and helpful. I had a huge delay so I missed first night, without even asking they deducted the night from my bill. And they were so flexible with pickup. I mean, I just don't have words enough to say how grateful I was to stay there! The owner and the staff is very concerned with the guests well being! When travelling for work its so nice when things just work out and the place you stay at is so welcoming. The food at the restaurant was also really good.
