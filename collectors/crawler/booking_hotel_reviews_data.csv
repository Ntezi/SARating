Anthurium Residential Hotel,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/anthurium-residential.html,"March 17, 2019","Sleepless nights due to rock hard bed and pillow and constant mosquitoes - no AC or ceiling fan and lots of holes in the windows so mosquitoes were unhindered! Staff could be more professional/competent. The actual rooms were pretty drab, no cleaning service during the day, either, and the restaurant was lacking in variety and consistency. It was also a bit of a noisy area.

Anthurium Residential Hotel,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/anthurium-residential.html,"September 16, 2018","I arrived sick from Uganda so had hoped for some rest at this hotel. Unfortunately that did not happen and the few days I was there I got no sleep or rest. Upon my arrival I noticed the primary school right next to the hotel. The school is in full swing from 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM with kids screaming and shouting outside. Then to my horror the next morning I got woken up at 3:30 AM by all the roosters in the area and at 5:00 AM I heard singing, screaming, shouting, preaching in a microphone and instruments being played. It turns out there is a church choir right next to the hotel also. This is how I got woken up every morning while there and the choir went on until 9:00 PM. At 00:30 one night I got woken up by guests checking into the room next to mine. The entire hotel was empty so why put guests next to me in the middle of the night? The African guests who arrived were SUPER noisy so I knocked on the wall for them to be quiet. They then complained about me. What! So the night receptionist came to my room and asked what the problem was. The guests were moved to another floor and all the noise with the suitcases etc. got too much for me. Not all the staff spoke English which caused some confusion in the restaurant. When I got to Kigali I called the hotel for directions but no one answered my first 3 attempts. The same thing happened 4 other times when I was in town calling for directions back to the hotel. One of the times I was standing in the rain. No desk chair or desk/bed side lamps. Daily power cuts, the cable TV did not work very well when it rained and not at all the last day I was there. Paper thin walls, no elevator, 2 hangers only in the closet, the hotel charges more for the airport transportation than the regular taxis. No safe box or fridge in the room, no shower curtains, no fan or a/c. The hotel is quite far from downtown. No phone in the room. I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a quiet place. Nice hot shower, strong reliable WI-FI connection, a large room, super clean throughout, nice staff and owner, comfortable bed, good food but super slow service. New furniture in the rooms.",September 2018,Bring ear plugs and hope for the best!!!!!!!!!,Anonymous

Anthurium Residential Hotel,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/anthurium-residential.html,"February 22, 2018","The location of this place is very far out of town.  There is nothing in the vicinity. The taxi drivers that the hotel called for us didn't speak English or French, and didn't know their way around town - it ended in annoyance both times.Also, I'm sorry to say, it's just too noisy for a pleasant stay. We stayed for 2 nights, and night 1 - at 4am I was woken by a Mosque, at 5am the preacher at the church next door started screaming through a megaphone, and by 8am the primary school was in full swing.  Megaphone praying lasted from 6am to 6pm, with no chance of quiet.  Night 2 - a football team arrived at around 7/8 in the morning and began screaming and shouting, banging on doors - and continued all day.I feel bad saying this because the owners are generally great and lovely people, but we didn't sleep for 2 days because of the noise so I think it's fair to warn others. The room was very nice - comfy bed, exceptionally clean (although no daily service of the room), and powerful shower.  The breakfast was really delicious (omelette, pancakes and fresh fruits), and it's also a great benefit to have a good restaurant on location - the night we arrived we enjoyed drinks and nice fish and meat kebabs for dinner.  The staff are very, very friendly - although yes, you should speak French to communicate well with them.",February 2018,"Lovely owners, good facilities, incredibly noisy",Gabriella

After the first night, we were able to change to the nicer room we actually booked, but the front desk staff behaved as though it was a favor to allow us to do so. When we realized we'd left our plug adapters in the first room, new guests were already checked in and despite asking housekeeping and the front desk multiple times throughout the day, they were never recovered. The driver offered by the hotel is ludicrously expensive, arrange your own taxis. The coffee was good, and the restaurant at breakfast has nice atmosphere and we enjoyed the food choices, though they don't change from day to day.",August 2018,"Didn't meet my expectations for a mid-range property, the worst stay we had while in East Africa.",Nicole

The location is wonderful (as a solo female traveler, I appreciated feeling safe walking around the neighborhood on my own), the rooms are comfortable and clean, and I enjoyed having a hot shower, ample filtered water, and a working tv. The restaurant provided delicious and reliable food, by far the best of any of the hotels I’ve stayed at in the country. But what’s most special about Heaven is the staff! They went above and beyond to make me feel welcome during my first visit to Rwanda and really make this place feel like home. I’ve traveled all over the world and I’ve never experienced such warmth from a hotel. As if everything wasn’t perfect enough, they kindly gave me a free upgrade due to my long stay.

The restaurant, however, is NEXT LEVEL. Honestly some of the best food I've had all year- not just in Kigali and not just in Africa. Every single thing we had was phenomenal and there's a ton of options for every diet and palate. Everything from amazing crispy chicken lollipops and decadent creme brulee to a tasty veggie burger and hearty pumpkin stew. The breakfast (included on the hotel) was incredible as well.

The reason i came back was because of the location which is fantastic and the breakfast. But now i really regret my decision.
This is the worst hotel experience i have had, the first night was really bad. First of all, when i was checking in, i was told the room that i booked was not available so i had to be given a different room. One with two twin beds that were really tiny. They offered to join up the beds and promised to move me the following day to a room according to my booking. The whole thing was handled really well by the hotel staff in particular Fiable, i did not seem to mind the inconvenience just for a night.
The worst part and the worst experience is that at around midnight on my first night i woke up because i was being bitten by BEDBUGS. Unbelievable. I could not imagine such a ''posh'' hotel could have bedbugs. It calls to question their hygiene standards. I immediately woke u and rushed to the reception to complain, and so that they could believe me, i took photos of the bugs and even carried a sample of a big bedbug to the reception and gave it to Fiable. So my room had to be changed in the middle of the night. Of course i did not sleep well as i kept on waking up at night many times to check if my new bed and room has those bugs. I did not see any in this one.
Following day, my room was changed to the one i had booked but then again i experienced a different challenge in my third room. The internet connection was terrible. (please note other areas of the hotel, and other rooms i had been in, internet was excellent). In this room it was so bad. I complained several times about it till i gave up. So i struggled to do my work (reason i was here) with terrible internet, of course it was frustrating for the remaining days i spent in the hotel.

Five to Five Hotel,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/five-to-five.html,"March 10, 2019","summary: We experienced some unfortunate serious issues with check in, airport pickup, a scheduled transfer, and the location.
main issue:
15 minutes before heading to the airport to fly to kigali, i get a text from them saying there are no more rooms left and they'll have to book us somewhere else to stay for the night. how frustrating is that when i had booked well in advance and had confirmed with them multiple times leading up to our trip, including the day before. left worrying about the location and how that will impact the important early morning tour pickup that is now too late to change. also meant we couldn't hit our laundry window and lost precious sleep time. (Later on when asked they explained it was because an existing guest decided to extend their stay. A confirmed booking should not be a ""maybe, if our other guests feel like it"". Unreliable.
Second issue:
Airport pickup: we get to guest-pickup area and don't see our names. We wait 20 minutes before i call. They insists that the pickup driver is there. I wait a bit and finally see my name. The driver had apparently been there but had such a stack of name cards he was flashing that he never flashed our names. To avoid this in the future simply include the hotel name on the cards and waiting guests will know to approach and confirm.
Issue 3:
I had pre-arranged and re-confirmed a morning transfer with the hotel to our tour location. but it was 30 mins late, I had the hotel call the tour company and plead with them to wait. Luckily they waited but they had to keep a group of 10 waiting and we were ""those jerks"" who made everyone wait. Stressful, annoying, unreliable.
Issue 4:
The general location was not that good. One night there was loud partying till 5am. A second afternoon there was a 2 hour shouting match between vendors. 
All said i would not stay there again and would find a better place. Positives:
Staff were very apologetic and friendly

Five to Five Hotel,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/five-to-five.html,"January 14, 2019","I would have loved to taste the Rwandan/African cuisine. This was not offered on the menu. Mainly European dishes were on offer. I came to Rwanda to explore, so it would have been nice if they promote their local or other African cuisine too, as African cuisines are extremely versatile, organic and healthy. This was my only minor for the hotel.I had to get used to the overall sight of armed security forces everywhere you go in Kigali. I felt like I was in a police state and could get shot any moment if I made the wrong move. Even in the hotel, you and your bags had to go through this security portal. Because of this, I didn't really, feel free. At several occasions during my tour I was told not to film or take any pictures of certain areas (presidential/governmental areas) - and the way I was cautioned not to do it, was told with such fear in the voice. My usual self would have ignored the warning and taking a cute picture of myself and the surroundings, with no harm in mind. Uganda also had armed forces, but they were less intimidating and more accommodating than in Rwanda. I find it sad that people have to live in fear. On the other hand, I understand given the history. Crime is very low, things are well organised in comparison to other African countries. World class experience. By far the best place I've stayed in East Africa, and for overall experience, the best place I've ever stayed. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a refreshing drink, and my bags were dropped off in my room. I was able to have breakfast too. The best part of the room was the magnificent view overlooking the hills/mountains of Kigali. This made me enjoy the balcony even more. I wish I could have stayed longer. The bed was comfortable and the AC worked. They even thought of having an Iron in the room, and other basic items like toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving razors, water etc. More than I expected. After visiting 5 countries in less than a month in East Africa,  and staying at places that have no understanding of the needs of their customers, I felt really at home in this hotel. The staff were also very friendly. I never drink tea with milk, but I did enjoy the African tea very much. I will look for the recipe, so I can make it at home. Airport pickup was just brilliant.

You can only communicate basic info with some of the staff. We learned who spoke the best English and just waited until they came to work to communicate with them. The beds are hard as a rock. If you like hard beds, then you will be fine. If not, expect to come home with a backache. There is a lot of abject poverty in Rwanda and this property is built next to what I would call a shanty town. Homes with sheet metal roofs, pothole-filled dirt road, etc. To be fair, it's not uncommon for there to be multi-million dollar gated homes right next to shacks, so that's not an issue. Just don't be alarmed when you arrive at the property after traveling down a dirt road for a couple hundred yards and see these shacks right outside the walls of the property.Because there is a working class neighborhood right next to the property, it is very loud on the road, very early in the day. There is a lot of street noise, people yelling at each other, and children in the streets from sunup on throughout the day. It is impossible to sleep if you are not in the bedroom with the air conditioning going. Please note that we never felt unsafe. There is also a guard on duty at the locked gate 24 hours a day. Just know that someone will be honking a car horn or yelling at someone from the street as early as 5:30 am every day. Overall, the apartment was great and EVERYTHING was very clean. The staff was very accommodating and repaired items whenever we made them aware of the situation. The staff was very polite and everyone was a hard worker.  They have a car service that was great.

#hotelTmpl","March 26, 2019","The breakfast did not arrive as ordered, so I went to find out what was going on, There was no staff around, except there was some activity in the kitchen. The security staff was having a morning wash for everyone to see. I want back several times and there was still no staff. it is now 7.45 am and the strangest breakfast arrived. We had no time to eat it really, so we took our bags and left the room. There was still no staff thus we had no way of checking out. Our driver is it happened was waiting inside the property and he can testify there was no one there to check us out. with a long drive ahead we left, knowing the hotel had our cc details and with booking.com being the conduit we deemed this to be fine in terms of payment. However, we discovered a few hours into our trip that we had omitted leaving the key behind. Speaking with the hotel I assured them we would bring the key back on our return to Kigali 2 days later. I was then told by the Belgian owner Rudy he would call the police to report us for leaving without paying and with the keys. Nothing I could do about that other than sticking by our word to bring the keys back which we did. meanwhile I received several calls from the increasingly erratic owner. He then elected to charge us a relatively huge sum for purportedly changing the locks to the room we had stayed in as we had the key. This in itself is odd for more than one reason. I have certainly never been to a hotel where the one room key handed to the guests is the only key for that room. Secondly, this key was also used to enter into the guest room area of the establishment. I never received a breakdown of the bill and when I returned with the key the owner was not there and he has not picked up the phone on the many I tried contacting him since. I would insist in receiving the invoice and of course also to be credited for the ridiculous sum charged. I would expect booking.com to assist without taking sides, and post this review. Thanks. the steak at dinner was good, after we sent the first back as it came well done and we asked for medium rear.

For now you have to pick up the keys from the bar.I had some difficulties finding the light switch to turn of the lights from the terrace, but the guard was very helpful. If this place continues to deliver the same service and comfort at this price-level it will easily become the best hotel / bed and breakfast in Kigali. Absolutely wonderfully decorated room with private terrace and superb bed. Very cool vibe to the whole place, which includes a nice pool and lounge bar/restaurant. The hosts are super friendly and very eager to improve on even the smallest details. Thanks for the welcome drink as well Reggie! Also I can highly recommend the breakfast which is very good value for money, and will be delivered at your private terrace.",October 2017,My new ultimate rest and relaxation spot.

All the construction of the rooms are horrible ! The doors and the windows having gap ! In that case hundreds of mosquitos doing party in you boddy !
And someone clever ask me ? Why don't use your bed net ! Did it ... passing through was full of holes ! 
Then you have your private zoo garden in your room ! Cockroaches welcomes you and some mouse droppings , left and right of tour bed !
Then you can see the walls with full of killed mosquitos and the blood of someone on the wall !
Of course dirty walls !
Then if you walk for few steps without flip flips to the floor your feet are red , black and stacking stuff ! An extremely dirty floor where they wash it once a year ! 
The room smelling disgusting because they don't open the windows ! But how to open the windows ? Are guarantee you will have huge company of mosquitos in the night almost in the day !
They wifi doesn't work at all ! Been to a restaurant almost 500 meters far away to Kisimenti market to get some !
Hot water ? What is that ! 
No isolation about noise ! So if they talking at midnight outside you hear them like to be in your rooom ! Horrible 
Also been lucky and cancel an extra night for staying  ! 
Just a really bad hotel one of my worsest ever stayed !!! If was able to get to 0 as a score here to booking I will do that !
Two nights don't slept and countdown the time to get out of there ! I don't suggest it for any reason ! Only if you like all the above 😊

I was informed this was due to the on-going construction works - including for the swimming pool. I stayed at Phoenix Apartment Plaza for 6 nights and everything that is advertised about this place is correct. It exceeded my expectations.  The place is tide and rooms spacious. The apartment comes with a fully furnished kitchen, a dining table, a big single door refrigerator, two bedrooms (1 self-contained), a beacon with wonderful views. For the price, it offered me a feeling of a ""true home away from home"". The staff was amazingly helpful, from the staff manager Channy, receptionists - Richard & Lillian, the Chef, and the cleaning ladies.Commuting to and from the city - depending on the time that you need, e.g. to get into the city at (I started work at 8 am), my best advice would be taking local motorcycles (they operate as a taxi) and fairly priced compared to a normal taxi. Taxis are handy too but much expensive and unlike the motorcycles, they tend to take ages to reach the city. The third option is to download a local App ""MOVE"" and you can easily order a ride - I took this option to & from the airport (the airport is very close to the apartment - 'However, when flying out make sure you leave a lot of time for going through a lot of security layers').Would I recommend this place? - oh yes! 100 %",March 2019,I had a lovely time,Jack

#hotelTmpl","April 7, 2018","- Some of the pictures posted on booking.com can be misleading as they showcase the entire full plan of Phoenix Apartments to which only 25% of has been built. - For instance traveling with kids, the swimmingpool was one of the major reason we decided to stay there, so you could imagine how hard it was having to tell a 5years old that the pool we promised and we saw in the pictures wasn't there afterall. - There is no doubt that Phoenix Apartments is one of the good parts-hotels out there and i acknowledge the fact that it is still undergoing construction, but it would be a great deal for the guests if the road to the apartments from the main road could be renovated just a little bit as it's in a very bad shape for cars to drive in, especially when it rains.- Another thing that disturbed us was the unprofessional* of housekeepers who had to be re-reminded to clean the apartments and to change the towels on a daily basis resulting in having it done late in the afternoons or not at all, although it is supposed to be a part of their daily routines. Beautiful, modern, clean, comfort, private homes/condos/apartments yet with best exclusive hotel services, such as doormen service, housekeeping/daily-cleaning service and a 24/7H reception.Great family friendly place/location or for those looking for privacy far from down-town chaos but yet with easy route to the city (for those with a car) as well as shorter trip to the airport. The rooms are big with huge big glass windows/doors to each balcony and are furnished with big closets, kingsize beds with private toilets and showers, and the apartments are well equipped with everything you'd need in a normal household from microwave, stove, washing-machine and all kinds of kitchen utilities (although it would be nicer with more glasses, plates and cups). Another thing that amazed us was how far some employees would go providing that extra best services to your guests. A big thanks to Channy, a wonderful friendly receptionist who was there to answer all our various questions as well as helping out to resolve whatever issues we had whenever asked 24/7 wether by phone or in person. Another big thanks to Tony, a fantastic nice young man who suddenly took the charge of being our private chef, cooking us whatever/whenever we wanted throughout our entire stay after realising that the stove in our partment had some electric issues and wasn't gonna work.

I was not aware of this initially so I left for the day with my key only to come back and be explained to the above. Patience was very quick in sorting me out and we waited while they cleaned the room at 10 p.m. (which was quite nice of them actually to do it at that hour). However we could have avoided all this if there had been some prior communication. Colourful rooms with such character, look very fresh, really nice showers. The decor of Yambi is quite nice, very nice for photos which my best friend and I took many of.  My favourite part of the place was the swing, where I would spend some quiet time. The food was good.

I would never have selected and booked a room with a shared bathroom had I known ... the owner reduced the price of that room to the advertised price for a room with a shared bathroom, from $40 to $35, and I stayed at the guest house rather than look for a new place to move to. Having a shared bathroom was inconvenient though so potential guests should confirm the situation before they make the reservation and make sure they are happy with the set up.The wifi was unreliable at times but this might not be the guesthouse's fault. It was most likely a network issue... The employees who reside behind the bedroom I occupied were noisy on most of the mornings and disturbed my sleep. The owner was supportive when I raised this with him. Staff are helpful and friendly. The accommodation is good value for the price. The breakfast was good too. I liked the location and could easily walk to, or go by moto taxi to, all of the places I was keen to see. The owner is really helpful. I had a good time and have already recommended it to my friends!",June 2017,Staff are helpful and friendly.,Anonymous

Centre San Jose Carmelo,https://www.booking.com/hotel/rw/centre-san-jose-carmelo.html,"January 4, 2019","Bathroom had a persistently bad smell,; no AC or fan and it got muggy in the early evening; no TV ; no kettle or tea/coffee utensils; no fridge in the room; had issue with insects in the room (as balcony door has to be left open) and has to go buy insect spray from pharmacy ourselves; no restaurant in the hotel, so no food available except breakfast (which was simple but very nice).All in all, this hotel is between a 2* and a 3* (definitely not a 4* as advertised, especially when compared to other 4* hotels in the city). Even our tour guide was adamant it was a 2*. So, for a 2*, it would certainly be ""excellent"" ; for a 3* it would be ""quite good"" Really lovely staff, and quiet atmosphere.
